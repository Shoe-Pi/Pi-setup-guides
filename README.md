# Pi-setup-guides

A collection of guides for customising the functionality of your Raspberry Pi.

When I set up a fresh Pi there are a lot of tweaks and modifications I like to make to the fresh install.  This folder is a collection of guides and files/boilerplate code for doing this, because it's a bit more convenient to have these collected in the same place, and I wanted to add some additional information to some of the excellent guides which are already out there.
