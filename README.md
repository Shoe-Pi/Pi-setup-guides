# Pi-setup-guides
A collection of guides for setting parts of the Pi up

When I set up a fresh Pi there are a lot of tweaks and modifications I like to make to the fresh isntall.  This folder is a collection of guides and files/boilerplate code for doing this, because it's convenient to collect all of these in a single place.
